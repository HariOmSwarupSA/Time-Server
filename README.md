#  Time Server using TCP connection
This is a simple demonstration of how time servers can be implemented using socket programming using python. So, there are two program files named as `client.py` and `server.py`. The server listens to the clients request made, and response by sending date and time back to the client. The Client has the option to choose any time zone, and requests to the server.
